# (amscanne): We control the monkey_patch() manually. At a previous point,
# we had lots of problems when it was applied unilaterally. Now, we see all
# kinds of problems when it's not. I believe that most of the previous issues
# we saw were isolated bugs that have now been fixed. I belive that the problems
# popping up now are due to lack of patching in the os module. But this is some
# black magic.

# so that we may pull out the connection string paramters.
